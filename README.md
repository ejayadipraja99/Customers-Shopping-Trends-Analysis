## Conclusion

To increase sales by 10% in the fall season from the previous season, you can do several things, namely:

- Due to the large number of "R" shop customers who are male and the majority are also in the 'Adult' age range, we can increase the number of products that are liked by men in the 'Adult' age range.

- Because "R" stores in the state of Montana get the most sales, the strategies carried out in the state of Montana can be applied to "R" stores in other states and for "R" store branches in the state of Montana itself can continue to strive to get the highest income.

- The category of goods that is most often purchased at "R" stores is clothing and the second is accessories, therefore it can increase the number of goods in the Clothing and accessories categories in "R" stores.

- In the Fall season, purchases at the "R" store get the largest number of purchases, therefore, in order to maintain sales levels, continue to implement existing strategies and continue to increase sales

- Because review ratings are very important for sales at "R" stores, therefore you must always monitor the quality of the goods sold so that goods sold from "R" stores do not get low ratings.

- Even though discounts and promotions have no effect, they are still carried out as promotional media

- Continue to use the membership system to attract more customers
